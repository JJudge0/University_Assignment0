# Assignment0



# MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSESSMENT
In this assignment, you will work with your team to design and implement a computer program.
The purpose of this assignment is to help you build the skills and knowledge that you need to successfully undertake Assignment 2 – Software Design and Assignment 3 – Software Implementation. In this assignment, you will receive feedback and ongoing support from the teaching team and your tutor. In addition, working with your group will give you the opportunity to learn from each other.
Finally, a description of your individual contributions to the team as part of this assignment should be included in the Group Presentation of Assignment 1 – Group Project Review.
# DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSESSMENT
The Task
You and your team should work together to design the algorithm and implement a Java program that works in a similar way to a calculator.
The Calculator should be able to perform the following operations:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers [Subtask 1]
2. Power, modulo, and square/cube roots [Subtask 2]
3. Conversions between temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit) [Subtask 3]
4. Conversions between Metric and Imperial units for mass (g/oz) and length (cm/inches) [Subtask 4]
5. Conversion of a decimal number to binary [Subtask 5]
6. Conversion of a binary number to decimal [Subtask 6]
7. Conversion of a decimal number to hexadecimal [Subtask 7]
8. Conversion of a hexadecimal number to decimal [Subtask 8]
In particular, the Calculator must have the following core functionalities. It must:
- Display the list of available operations and ask the user which operation they would like to perform.
- Ask the user to input the number(s).

Department of Computer Science
- Perform the calculation and display the result.
- Ask the user if they want to continue (‘Y’ or ‘N’). If the user selects ‘Y’, it should continue running. If the user selects ‘N’, it should exit.
You can design and implement the Calculator with a console user interface (the input is entered and the output is displayed on the console).
Proposed Additional Functionalities
Feel free to go above this specification and include additional functionalities that will make your Calculator even more powerful. Here are some suggestions:
o Graphical User Interface (for example, windows, buttons, textboxes, drop-down menu, etc.)
o Dealing with erroneous user input (for example, user enters a String instead of a number).
o Other scientific calculator features such as memory
o Extra operations (such as logs, factorial, and primes), unit conversions, and trigonometric functions
o File reading/writing such as reading user input from a text file and outputting the results of the calculations into a text file
o YOUR OWN IDEAS
Guidance
This is a group task – that is, the group must design and implement this program, and all members are responsible for delivering a ‘final product’ that meets the requirements and for delivering it on time.
Therefore, the group must divide the work among its members carefully, coordinate well, and work closely with each other.
To ensure that everyone contributes to the work, each member of the group must choose one of the eight Subtasks and produce the design and implementation for that subtask. If you like, you can work in pairs, given that Subtasks 1&2, Subtasks 2&3, Subtasks 4&6, and Subtasks 7&8 are related.
You will demonstrate the program to your group tutor during your tutorial in week 12. Groups that have collaborated effectively and produced outstanding work will be nominated by their tutors for the ‘Best Group’ award.
Advice:
- Design: draw your main flowchart/pseudocode, first, and ensure that all members follow the same notation and format when working on their individual flowcharts/pseudocode.
- Implementation: code your ‘main method’, first, and ensure that all members follow the same style when coding their individual methods.
- There are eight Subtasks, because most teams consist of eight members. If your team has fewer members, you are encouraged to still try to complete all eight subtasks. Remember this assignment is all about learning and gaining experience, so “the more you put in the more you get out”.
Assignment Elements
This assignment has two elements:
1) Software Design
The design must be included in a report. The report should not exceed 20 pages and should have the following contents:
a) Cover page indicating the module code; module title; assignment title; your group name (e.g., Green05); names and IDs (e.g., 0712345) of all team members; name of your tutor.
b) Requirements Specification
Make a list of the functionalities that the program must have.
The specification should include the core functionalities given above, plus the additional functionalities that you have come up with, if any.

c) Algorithm Design
Draw flowcharts AND write pseudocode to describe the steps and logic of the program that meets the specification.
State whether your design meets the specification. If not, state which functionalities it omits.
If needed, feel free to include comments to explain the design.
Note: You must use the notation presented in Lectures 4 and 5 to create your flowcharts and pseudocode, respectively.
2) Software Implementation
Produce a Java program that implements the functionalities specified in 1b) above.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES AND MARKING CRITERIA
This assignment is not marked. However, it is set in such a way that it resembles and prepares you for Assignment 2 – Software Design and Assignment 3 – Software Implementation. As such, this assignment shares the same learning outcomes and some of the marking criteria to be used in Assignments 2 and 3. Your tutor will use these learning outcomes and marking criteria to give you feedback.
In completing this assignment, you will demonstrate the ability to:
LO1: Plan, manage and track a non-trivial activity.
LO2: Take an open-ended problem and define and refine the requirements.
LO3: Effectively present and communicate solutions to their peers.
LO4: Create and use technical documentation.
LO5: Produce a working computer program as a solution to a given non-trivial problem.
LO6: Develop skills in the use of high-level object-oriented languages.
The learning outcomes and ‘marking criteria’ for each element in Assignment 0 – Formative Task are shown below.

# FORMAT OF THE ASSESSMENT
This assignment is group-based. This means that the submitted work should be a joint piece of work of all group members. There will be only one submission for the group. After the submission is made, your group tutor will provide you with feedback. This will be done both informally and formally.
During your normal tutorial meeting in week 12, you will explain your algorithm to your tutor and demonstrate the program. Informally, your tutor will give you their view of the algorithm you presented and of the implementation and offer you advice on how you can improve on the work you have done. Formally, the tutor will provide a short feedback summary on Wiseflow.
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
One member of the group must submit a single ZIP file consisting of your (1) report in PDF format and (2) all Java files of your program. Your group name must be used for the file name (e.g., Green05)
The group member must submit the ZIP file on Wiseflow by 11:00GMT, Friday 11th December 2020.
As indicated above, your report should not exceed 20 pages and should contain the following:
a) Cover page indicating the module code; module title; assignment title; your group name (e.g., Green05); names and IDs of all team members; name of your tutor.
b) Requirements Specification
c) Algorithm Design (flowcharts and pseudocode)
You are responsible for checking that you have uploaded the correct versions of your report and Java program files. Once the deadline has passed the submission cannot be changed.
